#Basic Enviornment Setup
Made by: Sredna Kunowski with help from previous team members!

This is all about a basic template for starting out a project. It has lots of npm modules saved as dependencies (like gulp, angular, webpack etc), so just run npm install to get them all. There's a gulpfile that can run a local server (port 8000), along with many other tasks (webpack, livereload, compile sass etc). Run gulp to open the port.
